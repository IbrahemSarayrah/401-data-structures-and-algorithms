# Singly Linked List

* Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

## Challenge

* to create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node, and create a Linked List class and the class contain insert includes and to string that representing all the values in the Linked List

## Approach & Efficiency

* Create a Node class
* Create a Linked List class that have insert,includes and to string

## API

* **insert()**: will take a value for adding a new node

* **include()**: to check if value is in the linked list or not and will return true or false

* **toString**: a string representing all the values in the Linked List
